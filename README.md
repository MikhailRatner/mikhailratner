### Hi there 👋, my name is Mikhail
#### I am a Full Stack Developer with a background in marketing and political science 🧑‍💻🙋‍♂️👨‍🎓

Currently, I am developing technologies for our clients at COSUTEC GmbH.

Skills: JS / ANGULAR / REACT / VUE / NODE / HTML / CSS / POSTGRESSQL

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and Bootstrap 


After more than 8 years of working experience in and around tech, I fulfilled my dream of becoming a full-stack developer.
 As a former journalist, consultant, and project manager, attention to detail, continuous learning, and team collaboration are natural to me.
 During those previous jobs, I gained strong skills in critical thinking and creative problem-solving.
